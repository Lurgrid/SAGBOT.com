## *SAGBOT.com* history

*SAGBOT.com* was launched at the end of 2021. Since its launch, the site has undergone numerous visual evolutions, each marked by frequent updates. However, one common thread runs through all these changes: the project has never been completely finished. Often, I lacked the motivation to work on the front-end, not really having the soul of an artist, nor the pen of a writer, I didn't know what to write to enrich the content.

The old versions were essentially made with **HTML/CSS/PHP/JS** and were often single-page websites (*SPA*). And as I said before, they were frequently empty of content, or even still contained fillers (*placeholder*) and even in the worst case links leading to *404* pages, because they weren't coded yet.

It got to the point where for months *SAGBOT.com* (before finally making this website) looked like this, just a black page with a simple &laquo; Welcome to SAGBOT.com &raquo; and a little animation that makes the text move.

## Current version

The current version is no longer based on the same technologies and has no longer the same purpose. As the *SAGBOT* project has evolved and become more personal, *SAGBOT.com* has become a personal website. At present, it's becoming a blog where I'll be posting articles on IT or even the evolution of the project, like this one.

### Design

First of all, I have to ask myself &laquo; How do I want *SAGBOT.com* to be? &raquo;. After some thought, and even discussion with friends, I came to the conclusion that *SAGBOT.com* should become a blog about my passion; computing, to be more in line with my career plan, which is to become a teacher-researcher (see [About](https://www.sagbot.com/fr/about)). Given that in the world of research, article writing is commonplace.

Once I had the subject, it was time to put it into shape. First of all, the monopage was a thing of the past, as it was incompatible with the idea of a blog. The writing had to be simple to implement. Having to recode a **HTML** page for each article would have been a hindrance, and the site would have ended up like the others, <u>empty</u>. Having mastered **LaTeX** and **Markdown**, and knowing the power of their syntaxes, I wanted to create articles using these languages.

One of the greatest advantages of **LaTeX** is the freedom it gives you, as well as the numerous packages enabling customized page layout (*Tikz*, etc.). Unfortunately, this advantage can become a drawback, complicating the compatibility of all packages in a **HTML** page generator. For these reasons, I've chosen to use **Markdown**.

Being an admirer of the **Rust** programming language, I initially wanted to make this site with one of the following libraries: [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs), [mdx-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs). When I asked about [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/), it seemed the perfect candidate for making the articles, as this **Markdown** format allows you to use **JS/JSX** in a **Markdown** document. However, in discussions with friends who also have websites, they advised me not to use **MDX**, but instead to use **Markdown**-based website builder tools such as [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) or [**Zola**](https://www.getzola.org/). They were much more suited to my needs, and I didn't even have to redo the whole thing. One of my friend even had a website created with **Hugo** and was very happy with it.

After reading the documentation for both tools, **Hugo** seemed simpler and more in tune with what I wanted to do. That's why I ended up using **Hugo**. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, I'm not an artist, so I use a [Hugo Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme made by [panr](https://radoslawkoziel.pl/) and made available to everyone, with colors generated by the [Terminal.css](https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/) tool.

### Articles

As I said before, the articles that will appear on *SAGBOT.com* will be about computing, and will cover a wide range of topics that I like. The aim will be to write articles from time to time, in the hope that people will find them interesting. To make these articles accessible, they will all be translated into English, as this is an international language.

## Conclusion

The creation of *SAGBOT.com* has been a common thread ever since I discovered computing. Throughout my learning process, whether academic or self-taught. I've tried to bring every bit of knowledge to life on this site.

Adopting **Hugo** as my website generator was an important decision, facilitating article management and ensuring scalability. This transition underlines the importance of choosing the right tools for a long-term project vision. Finally, the integration of themes gave *SAGBOT.com* a visual identity, despite my self-perceived lack of artistic ability.

In the future, *SAGBOT.com* will continue to grow as a resource dedicated to computing and the evolution of my larger *SAGBOT* project. I'm excited to share more knowledge, thoughts and discoveries with an audience.

I'm grateful for the support and advice received throughout development, which has been instrumental in overcoming obstacles and bringing this project to fruition.

Now all I have to do is write articles!
