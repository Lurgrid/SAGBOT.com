## What is *SAGBOT*?

*SAGBOT* is a collection of projects under the same name. Although these projects are not necessarily related, they are all IT projects whose aim was to automate tasks. The first project with this name was launched in 2018, and all projects associated with *SAGBOT* have been created entirely by myself. Over time, *SAGBOT* has become a personal project, evolving into a true personal brand reflecting my skills and passions.
