## Who am I?

I'm **E. HADDAG**, also known as **Lurgrid**. I'm currently in my first year of a Master's degree in computer science, research-oriented, with the ambition of doing a thesis after my Master's degree in order to become a teacher-researcher. I was born into the world of computing, so my inclination for it was straightforward. I started programming little games in the terminal when I was in middle school, and then went on to learn about the theory behind it while continuing to program.

## Technical skills

I'm proficient in several programming languages and technologies, including :

- **C** : My favorite language.
- **Rust**: My second favorite language, which solves the problems of *C*.
- **Java**: One of the worst languages in my opinion.
- **OCaml**: The language I've used to implement Quinn's *algorithm* and the *array method*.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript/HTML/CSS/PHP/SQL**: Languages that have enabled me to make websites including older versions of *SAGBOT*.
- **Promela**: Language used with *SPIN* for model checking.
- **LaTeX/Markdown**: Languages I use to write digital documents.

## Training

My studies have enabled me to acquire many computer science notions thanks to courses such as :

- **Algorithms and data structures**
- **Graph algorithms**
- **Text algorithms**
- **Calculability**
- **Compilation**
- **Language theory**

## Professional experience

I had the opportunity to do an eight-week internship as part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Rouen. This internship took place at the **GRÂ²IF** research laboratory (Groupe de Recherche Rouennais en Informatique Fondamentale) from April 22, 2024 to June 21, 2024, with L. MIGNOT as tutor. The theme of the internship was the study of the conversion of **Glushkov** automata into rational expressions. Production of a **Rust** library to handle this conversion.

## Projects and Contributions
